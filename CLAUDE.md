# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository is for implementing a digital version of "ito" (いと), a Japanese board game where players express numbered cards through creative descriptions based on themes, then try to arrange themselves in numerical order without directly revealing their numbers.

The repository is currently in its initial state and lacks development infrastructure, build systems, or source code.

## Current State

- The repository contains only a README.md with the project name "ito"
- Uses Apache License 2.0
- No build system, package manager, or development tools are configured yet
- No source code or application structure exists

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository without established tooling, future development will need to determine:
- Programming language and framework
- Build system and package management
- Testing framework
- Linting and formatting tools
- Project structure and architecture

When adding these components, this CLAUDE.md file should be updated with the appropriate commands and architectural guidance.
